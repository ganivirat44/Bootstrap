            Project Devil was officially launched under V.S. Narayanan, who became director of the DRDL in January 1972.[4] In June 1972, DRDL received 160 million rupees to fund both Project Devil and Project Valiant, though it came with a veil of secrecy; the Union Cabinet had publicly declined the funding request, but Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had granted it secretly through her discretionary powers.In turn, DRDL took pains to disguise the purpose of the funds so that their real work would not be immediately apparent. Project Devil specifically was given a budget of 50 million rupees to use within a three-year period. DLDR spent nearly half of the budget on importing equipment and supplies; it also subcontracted some of its labor, hiring the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited to cast a 350 kg magnesium liquid-fuel engine frame and a solid-booster rocket respectively. DRDL also began to expand rapidly, increasing its workforce from 400 to 2,500 people in a two-year period in an effort to meet staffing needs of both the projects

            To the extent that allowing southbound left-turns from Second Street to Brannan Street as described under the Project Variant can be considered a mitigation measure for Impact C- TR-13, the SFMTA Board finds allowing southbound left turns is infeasible because allowing left turns would increase the likelihood of collisions between left turning vehicles and pedestrians and northbound bicyclists.
